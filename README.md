### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hello! I am Jotham Wong and I am working towards my dream of becoming a professor. I am interested in systems research, notably distributed systems, cloud computing as well as low level computer architecture. I am currently working on a stream processing engine for my UROP. In a previous life, I was a software engineering intern at a Chinese social media company, a Southeast Asian food delivery company and a New York trading firm.
